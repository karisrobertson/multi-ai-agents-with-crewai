# Create Agents to Research and Write an Article

This repo contains hands-on projects from the [DeepLearning.AI x CrewAI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) course on building Multi-Agent Systems to Research and Wrtie and Article using LLMs.

## 🔧 Project

🚀- **Agent Chain Example**: I Just wrapped up my first multi-agent AI project using CrewAI from DeepLearning.AI and CrewAI's beginner-friendly course! I built a team of agents that collaboratively plan, write, and edit blog posts—like a newsroom powered by AI. In this project I created a Rearcher, Writer, and Editor agent collaborating sequentially to write an article about Aritifical Intelligence

- 🧠 Content Planner identifies the audience, trends, and SEO keywords

-  ✍️ Writer crafts a compelling opinion piece using the planner’s outline

-  📝 Editor refines the article to match brand voice and journalistic best practices

- 

I made sure each agent worked sequentially and independently, mimicking a real content workflow (no shortcuts or delegations).
This is just the beginning—I'm excited to keep building more multi-agent systems and exploring how AI teams can support real-world creative tasks
